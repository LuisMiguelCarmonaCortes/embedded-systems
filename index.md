# EMBEDDED SYSTEMS PROJECTS
Welcome to my Embedded Systems Projects blog! Here, I share the hands-on projects I’m working on, giving you a front-row seat to explore real embedded development. From designing custom circuit boards and programming microcontrollers at the bare-metal level, to working with embedded Linux systems on single-board computers, this blog covers a wide spectrum of electronics and software integration.

My goal is to create a personal laboratory in the open: a space where you can see projects ranging from fully digital power supplies with multiple controllable outputs, homemade function generators, oscilloscopes, and testers, to bus and protocol sniffers. Each project is built by hand, demonstrating practical electronics, hardware design, and programming in a tangible way.

You’ll also find tutorials and kits designed to learn bare-metal programming, embedded Linux, and hybrid systems that combine Linux with custom real-time operating systems—like my ongoing project “Robux.” These projects are designed to be educational, inspiring, and approachable, whether you’re a beginner or someone looking to deepen your knowledge.

This blog is not only about sharing what I do it’s an invitation to explore, experiment, and learn. Every project includes detailed explanations, schematics, and software examples so you can replicate, modify, or take inspiration to create your own embedded systems.

Come and lose yourself in this exciting world of DIY electronics.
